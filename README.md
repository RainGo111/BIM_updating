This repository contains the complete implementation of methods proposed in our paper for **semi-automated local updating of as-built BIM of piping systems using point cloud data**.

## üéØ Overview

Our approach addresses the challenge of maintaining accurate as-built BIM models by automatically detecting and quantifying geometric changes in piping systems through point cloud analysis.

### Key Features
- **Automated piping segmentation**: Direct extraction of piping networks from point clouds
- **Geometric change detection**: Quantification of changes in length, height, radius, and angle
- **As-designed vs As-built comparison**: Systematic analysis of design deviations

## üèóÔ∏è Methodology

### 1. Point Cloud Preprocessing
- **MATLAB Version**: 
  - Data processing for as-built point cloud models
  - Planar object segmentation
  - Multi-elevation piping system segmentation
- **PointNet++ Version**: 
  - Custom-trained network for direct piping segmentation
  - Real-time piping network extraction

### 2. Spatial and Topological Analysis
- **Geometric Parameter Extraction**: Automated measurement of pipe dimensions
- **Change Quantification**: Statistical analysis of geometric deviations

### 3. As-built BIM generation
- **As-designed Processing**: Revit model parameter extraction by using Dynamo
- **As-built Processing**: Point cloud-based geometric analysis

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Python environment
conda create -n bim-updating python=3.8
conda activate bim-updating
